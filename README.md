median-cut.js
=============

median-cut.js is a JavaScript implementation of the [Median Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_cut) algorithm for color quantization.  Median cut is typically used to reduce the number of colors in an image.  It can be used more generally to find clusters in any 3-dimensional data set.

Median cut is also useful for finding a color palette that "represents" an image.

median-cut.js was created for use in [ColorPal](http://mwcz.org/2012/01/16/colorpal-alpha/).
